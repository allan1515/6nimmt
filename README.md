# 6 nimmt!

6 nimmt! is a card game where players simultaneously choose cards and then play them in ascending order according to simple rules. Whoever plays the sixth card in a row has to take that row, which scores against them. While playing the game two questions came up:
 - Is playing randomly a viable/competitive strategy?
 - What happens when the parameters of the game (number of rows, starting cards in hand, which cards are in the game) are changed?
 
To answer these questions, I wrote this simple python implementation of the game. As it turns out, it is very easy to write an AI that beats a random player, and it does that across several different parameter settings.
